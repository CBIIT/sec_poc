### Lead Disease Matching Algorithm

Let $D_{ALL}$ be the set of all trials with the following attributes:

Attribute | Value
------------| -------------
current_trial_status | active
primary_purpose.primary_purpose_code | treatment or screening
sites.recruitment_status | ACTIVE
record_verification_date_gte |  two years prior to today's date

Let $P$ be the set of NCIt codes expressed for a given potential study participant.

Let $D_{API}$ be the set of trials returned by the CTAPI matching the diseases in $P$.  Note that $D_{API} \subseteq D_{ALL}$.  

Let $MT$ be a relation that maps a C code into a set of maintypes.  The domain of $MT$ is the set of all C codes.  The range of $MT$ is the set of maintypes.  Note that $MT$ may yield an empty set or a set of one or more maintypes.  

Let $c$ be a NCIt C code.  Traverse the NCIt digraph towards the root from $c$.  Let $l$ be the minimum distance between $c$ and any maintype encountered during this traversal.  The set returned by $MT$ is the set of maintypes that are exactly distance $l$ in the NCIt digraph from $c$.

Let $$P_{mt} = \cup_{c \in P} MT(c) $$

That is,  $P_{mt}$ is the union of the set of maintypes computed from the set of potential study participant data.  

Now consider a clinical trial $T \in D_{API}$.  Let $TD_{TL}$ be the set of c codes for the diseases associated with $T$ with the following attributes :

Attribute | Value
--------- | -------
inclusion_indicator | TRIAL
lead_disease_indicator | YES

Let $$T_{mt} = \cup_{d \in TD_{TL}} MT(d)$$.  

That is $T_{mt}$ is the union of the set of maintypes computed from the set of TRIAL level lead diseases.

A lead disease match is obtained for a given trial if $$  T_{mt} \cap P_{mt} \neq \emptyset $$
That is, there is at least one common maintype in the set of maintypes for the trial and the potential study participant data.
