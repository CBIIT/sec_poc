In production, if the packages are out of sync with dev (master), it can lead to difficult issues to debug. The [installed.packages](installed.packages) files are meant to help with resolving package version updates. When updating in production (really just reinstalling a newer version with `install.packages('package')`), R may complain about `ERROR: 'configure' exists but is not executable -- see the 'R Installation and Administration Manual'`. The source code is installed to some /tmp/dir/ before it can be compiled. Unfortunately once the gz file is extracted and ready for compile, the owner is set to `users` and the root user cannot execute. [Please see this article for explanation](https://vsoch.github.io/2013/install-r-packages-that-require-compilation-on-linux-without-sudo/). Essentially the source code needs to be installed in a folder that the root user has full exec access to. Setting the TMPDIR environment variable before executing the R install is what fixes the issue
